# Calendar Spark

Lightweight Next.js app that shows the current month's calendar with a playful "spark" effect whenever you click a day. Perfect for quick hosting on Vercel.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the calendar.

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, create a new project and import the repository.
3. Use the default Next.js build settings (`npm run build` & `npm start`).

That's it — the calendar ships with sensible defaults and no environment variables.
